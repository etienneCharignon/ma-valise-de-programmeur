Qu'est-ce qu'on apprend en lisant du code ?

Il existe 5 raisons qui font que le code est ce qu'il est :
- limitation de la machine
- limitation du langage
- limitation du programmeur
- historique
- specification (at last!)

«There are many reasons why programs are built the way they are, although we may fail to recognize the multiplicity of reasons because we usually look at the code from the outside rather than by reading it. When we do read code, we find that some of it gets written because of machine limitations, some because of language limitations, some because of programmer limitations, some because of historical accidents, and some because of specifications --both essential and inessential. But for whatever reason a particular piece of code gets inserted into the final product, there are psychological aspects to that reason-- which leads us to believe that studying programming as human behaviour will bear numerous and not always expected fruits.»
